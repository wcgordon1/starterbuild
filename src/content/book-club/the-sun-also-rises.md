After reading AI slop for 3 years in a row. Daily mind you. I have decided to make an effort on becoming a literate human once again. 

This book seems manly enough. We read the first three chapters aloud. Exchanging turns per page. Made me miss boxing kind of but also felt great to be inside on a bed.
